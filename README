Known issue

* Some people report problems with accented characters. If you encounter such
  problems, please send me a mail so I can fix it. If you can, send me a file
  where this happens. Central european characters work well and I don't have
  many songs with other international characters.

In any case, should you encounter problems with the script, let me know on http://code.google.com/p/itunes2amarok.
